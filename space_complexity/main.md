| Class          | Name               | Meaning                                                                   |
| -------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **O(1)**       | Constant Space     | Uses a fixed amount of memory — no matter how big the input gets          |
| **O(log n)**   | Logarithmic Space  | Space grows slowly; often seen in recursive algorithms like binary search |
| **O(n)**       | Linear Space       | Memory grows proportionally with the input size (e.g., copying a list)    |
| **O(n log n)** | Linearithmic Space | Combination of linear and logarithmic growth — rare in space complexity   |
| **O(n²)**      | Quadratic Space    | Memory grows with the square of input size (e.g., 2D arrays, matrices)    |
